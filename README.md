Multi-page website done using React.js and CSS. Categories for Electronics, clothing and accessories with working links to new pages for each. Top sellers displayed on the home page. Cart works properly and the correct amount of items stays for the duration of the websites use. Cart stays properly updated when tranistions through the different pages. Added smooth transitions between each section. Images with prices and dropdown to increase the amount desired in the shopping cart with the click of a button.
